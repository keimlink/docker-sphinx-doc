## What is Sphinx?

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. Output formats like HTML, LaTeX, ePub, Texinfo, manual pages and plain text are supported. More than 50 extensions contributed by users are available.

## How to use this image

### Use the image for your Sphinx project

First run `sphinx-quickstart` to set up a source directory and a configuration:

```console
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/docs":/home/python/docs keimlink/sphinx-doc:1.7.1 sphinx-quickstart docs
```

Then build the HTML documentation:

```console
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/docs":/home/python/docs keimlink/sphinx-doc:1.7.1 make -C docs html
```

### Create a `Dockerfile` for your Sphinx project

If you want to extend the image you can create a `Dockerfile` for your Sphinx project. In this example [sphinx-autobuild](https://github.com/GaretJax/sphinx-autobuild) will be used to rebuild the documentation when a change is detected.

Start with a requirements file called `requirements.pip`:

```console
sphinx-autobuild==0.7.1
```

Then create the `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM keimlink/sphinx-doc:1.7.1

COPY --chown=1000:1000 requirements.pip ./

RUN . .venv/bin/activate \
    && python -m pip install --requirement requirements.pip

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["sphinx-autobuild", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "/home/python/docs", "/home/python/docs/_build/html"]
```

Now build the image and run the container:

```console
docker build -t sphinx-autobuild .
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --rm -v "$(pwd)/docs":/home/python/docs sphinx-autobuild
```

The documentation should served at <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. It will be rebuild when a file is changed.

## Image Variants

The `sphinx-doc` images come in many flavours, each designed for a specific use case.

All images have the [enchant](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant) package installed. It is required by [sphinxcontrib-spelling](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/spelling) to spell check the documentation.

Processes inside the containers run as [non-privileged user](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2016/12/what-user-should-you-use-to-run-docker.html) `python` to improve [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#conclusions).

Python packages are installed into a virtual environment to [isolate](https://hynek.me/articles/virtualenv-lives/) them from the operating system.

## `sphinx-doc:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of [`python:alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/), which is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org/), available in the [`alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) official image. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

## `sphinx-doc:latex`

This image is based off of [python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) and contains all packages needed to build the LaTeX documentation. Because it's based off of [buildpack-deps](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/) and has a large number of extremely common Debian packages.
